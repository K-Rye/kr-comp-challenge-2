This challenge was a challenge... I just ran out of time and was not able to make it responsive. I wrestled using both grid and flexbox and ended up starting over at one point, clearly a little too late. I particularily struggled with the box contents. I learned a lot and know that I could finish, given more time but I know I have a lot yet to learn, including time management on future projects.
